Reach API
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reach/api.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/reach/api)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/reach/api/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/reach/api)

A back end API service setup that gives you the ability to pick and choose the modules you need for your project, mainly developed for the way I enjoy setting up my back end along with the ideas and wishes of my programming peers. It is built on KOA and Socket.io creating a robust and accessible experience for your development.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Kodemon/reach-api/wiki) for full documentation.

### NODE

Do not run with NODE `0.12.5`, it currently has install issues with istanbul. `0.12.4` is recommended.

### Install

First download this repo and unpack it into your destination of choice, then open your terminal and run npm install to install all the dependencies for the api.

```sh
# Install NPM packages
$ npm install

# Install reach-cli [optional]
$ npm install -g reach-cli

# Nodemon for local development [optional]
$ npm install -g nodemon
```

### Startup

After installing the npm dependencies, reach modules and services you can startup your server.

```sh
$ npm run local # Requires nodemon, edit the package.json scripts to change nodemon to node
$ npm run dev
$ npm run stag
$ npm run prod
$ NODE_ENV=env node --harmony server.js
```
