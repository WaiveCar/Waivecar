      <li>A driver’s license with too short of driving history (include your driver’s license with a longer history if you have one).</li>
      <li>An incorrectly entered date of birth on your application (make sure to use your birth year).</li>
      <li>A P.O. Box or business address on your application. All applications must use a residential address in their application.</li>
    </ul>
