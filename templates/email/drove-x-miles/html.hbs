  <h3>Hello {{ name }},</h3>
  <p>
    It's been a great {{numMonths}} months since you've joined us at WaiveCar! In that time you've had {{numBookings}} bookings - that's almost {{perMonth}} a month!
  </p>
  <p>
    That's {{gallons}} gallons of gas not put in a car<sup>1</sup>, {{pounds}} pounds of CO2 not put in the air<sup>2</sup>
    and ${{savings}} not removed from you wallet<sup>3</sup>!
  </p>
    Good job! Thanks for choosing WaiveCar and helping us build a brighter tomorrow!
  <p>
    Best regards,<br>
    The WaiveCar Team
