  <h3>Hello {{name}},</h3>
  <p>
    It's been a great {{numMonths}} months since you've joined us at WaiveCar! In that time you've had {{numBookings}} bookings - that's almost {{perMonth}} a month!
  </p>
  <p>
    That's {{gallons}} gallons of gas not put in a car <sup><small>1</small></sup>, {{pounds}} pounds of CO2 not put in the air <sup><small>2</small></sup>
    and ${{savings}} not removed from you wallet <sup><small>3</small></sup>!
  </p>
    Good job! Thanks for choosing WaiveCar and helping us build a brighter tomorrow!
  <p>
    Best regards,<br>
    The WaiveCar Team
