          <p>WaiveCar is the first ever FREE &amp; 100% electric car sharing program. We are ad-supported so the funds we receive from advertisers to display their ads on our roof-mounted screens and body wraps allow users to drive our cars FREE for 2 hours then $5.99/hr…MIC DROP.</p>

          <h4 id="whats-a-good-driving-record">What’s a good driving record?</h4>
          <p>To us, a good driving record means one without any:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>DUIs</li>
          <li>Moving violations</li>
          <li>Driving with a suspended license</li>
          <li>Any similar negligent or reckless acts</li>
          <li>Accidents</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="does-it-cost-any-money-to-sign-up">Does it cost any money to sign up?</h3>

          <h3 id="why-do-i-need-a-credit-card-to-sign-up-if-its-free">Why do I need a credit card to sign up if it’s free?</h3>

          <h3 id="can-i-use-an-out-of-state-drivers-license-to-drive-with-waivecar">Can I use an out of state drivers license to drive with WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>Yep! However, if you have a Pennsylvania, Utah or Washington license, please email us at support@waive.car as those states require a separate background check form to be filled out.</p>
          <h3 id="can-i-use-an-out-of-country-drivers-license">Can I use an out of country drivers license?</h3>
          <p>Yep! However you will need to contact your country’s DMV equivalent to obtain a driving record to email to us at support@waive.car (It must be translated into English)</p>
          <h3 id="can-i-use-a-temporary-drivers-license">Can I use a temporary drivers license?</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately you will need a permanent license to drive with WaiveCar.</p>
          <h3 id="how-long-does-the-signup-take">How long does the signup take?</h3>
          <p>It’s very quick! Should only take about 15 minutes for the signup and the background check to complete. If the background check seems to be taking longer, please contact us.</p>
          <h2 id="booking-cars">Booking Cars</h2>
          <h3 id="what-are-waivecars-hours">What are WaiveCar’s hours?</h3>
          <p>Our cars are available 24 hours and the customer service line is open from 9am-10pm. If you need assistance at other hours, simply send us an email at support@waive.car and we will reach you at our earliest convenience. </p>
          <h3 id="how-do-i-book-a-waivecar">How do I book a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>Log onto the app and find the closest available WaiveCar to you. You then have 15 minutes to get to the car before the reservation times out.</p>
          <h3 id="where-can-i-get-a-waivecar">Where can I get a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>Right now our cars are dispersed between Marina Del Rey and Hollywood, check our map in our app for more details.</p>
          <h3 id="how-long-do-i-have-to-get-to-a-waivecar">How long do I have to get to a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>You have 15 minutes to get to a WaiveCar before the reservation times out. You may purchase an additional 10 minutes for a $1 fee and $.30/min thereafter until you get to the vehicle. If you are 55 or over, you automatically get WaiveAid. WaiveAid allows you 25 minutes to get to your WaiveCar, for free, every time. You can still purchase an additional 10 minutes more for $1, totaling 35 minutes. If you are under 55 and need assistance, such as having a child in stroller or a handicap placard, please contact us</p>
          <p>Once you get there, please make sure you drive the WaiveCar! We may have to forfeit your booking if the WaiveCar isn’t being used. But don’t worry, we send out a message beforehand and you’ll have plenty of time to contact us if we’ve made a mistake.</p>
          <h3 id="can-i-reserve-a-car-in-advance">Can I reserve a car in advance?</h3>
          <p>Yes! We have a program where you can hold a car overnight for a special flat rate until 10AM of $14.99. Book a high charged car after 10PM and you will be offered a program we call WaiveRush. Hourly charges won’t begin until 10AM.</p>
          <h3 id="can-i-book-multiple-cars-a-day">Can I book multiple cars a day?</h3>
          <p>Yep! And even better, you will get the free 2 hours for EVERY ride!</p>
          <p>However, there is a 25 minute wait to re-book the car you just finished renting. We do allow you to skip the wait period for a fee.</p>
          <h3 id="does-the-free-2-hours-start-when-i-reserve-a-car-or-when-i-start-the-ride">Does the free 2 hours start when I reserve a car or when I start the ride?</h3>
          <p>When you start the ride! Enjoy your leisurely walk!</p>
          <h3 id="is-the-free-2-hours-only-when-im-driving-the-car">Is the free 2 hours only when I’m driving the car?</h3>
          <p>Nope! The free 2 hours counts for having the car while it’s driving or parked. </p>
          <h3 id="what-happens-if-i-dont-make-it-to-the-car-in-15-minutes">What happens if I don’t make it to the car in 15 minutes?</h3>
          <p>Then your reservation will expire! So make sure you book when you can get to the car within the free reservation time (15 minutes) and it’ll be free. You can rebook a missed reservation for a fee.</p>
          <h3 id="whats-with-that-20-charge-when-i-book-a-waivecar">What’s with that $20 charge when I book a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>No worries! It’s just a $20 hold on your card we will refund right back to you when your ride is complete!</p>
          <h2 id="driving-cars">Driving Cars</h2>
          <h3 id="how-far-can-i-drive-with-a-waivecar">How far can I drive with a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>You can drive up to 30 miles outside of any of our parking borders, which includes most of LA. You will get a text message alert when you have passed the boundaries! Along with being free the first 2 hours, a single WaiveCar can be rented for up to 12 hours at a time.</p>
          <h3 id="where-are-the-keys">Where are the keys?</h3>
          <p>There are no keys, simply use the app to lock, unlock and end all rides. </p>

          <h3 id="do-you-guys-cover-the-charging-station-costs">Do you guys cover the charging station costs?</h3>
          <p>If you use a charger listed in the app with our partners, EVgo, charging is free and can be done in under 30 minutes. You will also <a href="https://medium.com/@Waive/free-fast-charging-this-changes-everything-again-b7480f8d0dd4">receive credit</a> if you end the ride at a higher charge than when you began it at.</p>
          <h3 id="is-it-true-i-can-drive-in-the-carpool-lane-on-the-highway">Is it true I can drive in the carpool lane on the highway?</h3>
          <p>As of January 1, 2019, CA law has changed and some of our cars no longer have special car pool lane privileges because they need to be re-registered and re-tagged. We are working on making sure all of our vehicles have the proper decals and will notify you when they do. Until then, cars with a red decal on the back have special car pool privileges.</p>
          <h3 id="can-someone-else-drive-using-my-account">Can someone else drive using my account?</h3>
          <p>This one’s a big N.O. The ONLY person allowed to drive a WaiveCar is the person on the account who has booked the car. Big consequences if we find out otherwise!</p>
          <h3 id="what-happens-if-theres-a-parking-ticket">What happens if there’s a parking ticket?</h3>
          <p>If you get a ticket, you have 7 days to pay it. If you don’t pay it within that time, we will charge your account for the amount due. If you see a ticket from a previous user, simply put it in the glove box. You can also, if you’d like, take a photo of it during the end or beginning of your ride in the “issues” section so we can address it ASAP.</p>
