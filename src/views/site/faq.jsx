          <p>WaiveCar is the first ever FREE &amp; 100% electric car sharing program. We are ad-supported so the funds we receive from advertisers to display their ads on our roof-mounted screens and body wraps allow users to drive our cars FREE for 2 hours then $5.99/hr.</p>
          <p>Yes, 2 hours free, for a car, then half the price of an e-scooter every hour after.</p>

          <p>Log onto the app and find the closest available WaiveCar to you. You then have 15 minutes to get to the car before the reservation times out.</p>
          <aside>
          There’s two other ways to book WaiveCars: Through a simple website and through text. All the details are over on our medium site.
          </aside>
          <h3 id="where-can-i-get-a-waivecar">Where can I get a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>Right now our cars are dispersed between Marina Del Rey and Hollywood, check the map in our app for more details.</p>
          <h3 id="how-long-do-i-have-to-get-to-a-waivecar">How long do I have to get to a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>You have 15 minutes to get to a WaiveCar before the reservation times out. You may purchase an additional 10 minutes for a $1 and $.30/min thereafter until you get to the vehicle.</p>
          <p>Once you get there, please make sure you drive the WaiveCar! We may have to forfeit your booking if the WaiveCar isn’t being used. But don’t worry, we send out a message beforehand and you’ll have plenty of time to contact us if we’ve made a mistake.</p>
          <aside>
          Members 55+ automatically get an extra 10 free minutes (25 minutes total) to get to their WaiveCar. This program is available for anyone who needs assistance. Read more info at our blog.
          </aside>
          <h3 id="can-i-reserve-a-car-in-advance">Can I reserve a car in advance?</h3>
          <p>Yes! We have a program where you can hold a car overnight for a special flat rate until 10AM of $14.99 (info on the medium blog). Book a high charged car after 10PM and you will be offered a program we call WaiveRush. Hourly charges won’t begin until 10AM.</p>
          <h3 id="can-i-book-multiple-cars-a-day">Can I book multiple cars a day?</h3>
          <p>Yep! And even better, you will get the free 2 hours for EVERY ride!</p>
          <p>However, there is a 30 minute wait to re-book the car you just finished renting. We do allow you to skip the wait period for a fee.</p>
          <h3 id="does-the-free-2-hours-start-when-i-reserve-a-car-or-when-i-start-the-ride">Does the free 2 hours start when I reserve a car or when I start the ride?</h3>
          <p>When you start the ride! Enjoy your leisurely walk!</p>
          <h3 id="is-the-free-2-hours-only-when-im-driving-the-car">Is the free 2 hours only when I’m driving the car?</h3>
          <p>Nope! The free 2 hours counts for having the car while it’s driving or parked. </p>
          <h3 id="what-happens-if-i-dont-make-it-to-the-car-in-15-minutes">What happens if I don’t make it to the car in 15 minutes?</h3>

          <h3 id="whats-with-that-20-charge-when-i-book-a-waivecar">What’s with that $20 charge when I book a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>No worries! It’s just a $20 hold on your card we will refund right back to you when your ride is complete!</p>
          <aside>
          If you have credit in your account, for instance, by “topping up” and adding $20.00 on the website, the hold is reduced to just $1.00!

          <h2 id="driving-cars">Driving Cars</h2>
          <h3 id="how-far-can-i-drive-with-a-waivecar">How far can I drive with a WaiveCar?</h3>
          <p>You can drive up to 30 miles outside of any of our parking borders, which includes most of LA. You will get a text message alert when you have passed the boundaries! Along with being free the first 2 hours, a single WaiveCar can be rented for up to 12 hours at a time.</p>
          <h3 id="where-are-the-keys">Where are the keys?</h3>
          <p>There are no keys, simply use the app to lock, unlock and end all rides. </p>
          <h3 id="ive-never-driven-an-electric-car.-how-many-miles-per-charge-do-i-get">I’ve never driven an electric car. How many miles per charge do I get?</h3>
          <p>Our Hyundai Ioniqs have between 110-140 miles depending on driving style.</p>
          <aside>
          The best way to get all the miles you can is to take it slow, roll up the windows and turn down the heat.
          </aside>
          <h3 id="what-should-i-do-if-im-running-low-on-charge">What should I do if I’m running low on charge?</h3>
          <p>Check the app for the closest fast charger, or download the app “PlugShare”. Give us a call at 855-WAIVE55 if there is any confusion and we can direct you to one!</p>
          <h3 id="do-you-guys-cover-the-charging-station-costs">Do you guys cover the charging station costs?</h3>
          <p>If you use an EVgo fast charger listed in the app, charging is free and can be done in under 30 minutes.</p>
          <p>Also there is a company, Volta, which provides free charging at various retail stores for their current customers. Their “Level-2” chargers will add about 12 miles of fuel per hour charged.</p>
          <aside>
          You will receive credit if you end the ride at a higher charge than when you began it at. We have a variety of incentive programs you can participate in - read the medium blog for all the details.
          </aside>
          <h3 id="is-it-true-i-can-drive-in-the-carpool-lane-on-the-highway">Is it true I can drive in the carpool lane on the highway?</h3>
          <p><strong>Currently No:</strong> As of January 1, 2019, California law has changed and some of our cars no longer have special car pool lane privileges because they need to be re-registered and re-tagged.</p>
          <p>We are working on making sure all of our vehicles have the proper decals and will notify you when they do. Until then, cars with a red decal on the back have special car pool privileges.</p>
          <h3 id="can-someone-else-drive-using-my-account">Can someone else drive using my account?</h3>
          <p>This one’s a big N.O. The ONLY person allowed to drive a WaiveCar is the person on the account who has booked the car. Big consequences if we find out otherwise!</p>
          <h3 id="what-happens-if-theres-a-parking-ticket">What happens if there’s a parking ticket?</h3>
          <p>If you get a ticket, you have 7 days to pay it. If you don’t pay it within that time, we will charge your account for the amount due. If you see a ticket from a previous user, simply put it in the glove box. You can also, if you’d like, take a photo of it during the end or beginning of your ride in the “issues” section so we can address it ASAP.</p>
          <h2 id="ending-your-ride">Ending Your Ride</h2>
          <h3 id="where-can-i-park-when-im-done">Where can I park when I’m done?</h3>
          <p>If the battery is over 25 miles charged, you can park anywhere in the “green zone” on the map. Just follow the parking rules that are displayed when you attempt to end your ride. If the battery is under 25 miles charged you MUST return it at the headquarters at 2102 Pico Blvd in Santa Monica (Not 2102 Pico near S Alverado St).</p>
          <h3 id="where-can-i-not-park">Where can I <strong>NOT</strong> park?</h3>
          <p>Since we’re a public car sharing service, and a responsible member of the community, we need to make sure that cars are not only publicly accessible to others, but also can be retrieved at no cost or fee. We also do not want take up spaces set aside for private businesses. So this means no parking garages, permit-only spots, or any business parking lot.</p>
          <aside>
          We have a program where you can declare a parking space you own to be valid for any WaiveCar to park at called WaivePark described at our blog.
          </aside>
          <p>Restricted parking includes:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Street parking restricted by signs such as during street sweeping hours</li>
          <li>Private lots (Whole Foods, Ralphs, etc.)</li>
          <li>Private driveways &amp; Permit-only zones unless WaiveParked</li>
          <li>Upside down and engulfed in flames</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="how-do-i-end-my-ride">How do I end my ride?</h3>
          <p>First make sure that you are parked in an accurate spot (see above), turn off the car, grab your belongings, and exit the car. Select “End Ride” from the app and input the appropriate information. If you don’t receive a confirmation text please contact us.</p>
          <h3 id="do-i-need-to-clean-the-car-when-im-done">Do I need to clean the car when I’m done?</h3>
          <p>Our cars get used by many people each day before we see them again so yes, please be courteous and leave the car at least as clean as you found it. If you leave a mess, there could be a cleaning fee!</p>
          <h3 id="do-i-need-to-charge-the-car-before-i-end-my-ride">Do I need to charge the car before I end my ride?</h3>
          <p>This isn’t necessary but it is very helpful to us. We have a partnership where if you can charge the vehicle, it’s even better than free; we actually credit you towards future rides! We credit you for ending a ride with more miles than when you picked it up at no matter how you charge it. In our app there’s icons on the map during a booking that correspond to charging stations. There’s a help system in the app that describes exactly how this is done.</p>
          <p>If the car is under 25 miles charged, either charge it or return it to 2102 Pico in Santa Monica.</p>
          <aside>
          The gates at our lot never close and WaiveCars can be returned at any hour at any charge there. Please tidely park the car so others can access the lot.
          </aside>
          <h3 id="fees"><a name="fees"></a>Fees</h3>
          <p>There are some modest fees in order to keep our fleet bright and shiny.</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Ending with under 20 miles charge and not brought back to WaiveCar’s lot</strong> $20</li>
          <li><strong>Dead Battery / Lights Left On</strong> $100</li>
          <li><strong>Missing Key (Failure to return equipment)</strong> $300</li>
          <li><strong>Parking Violation (Any violation of our parking rules)</strong> $40</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle Recovery (If left outside Santa Monica)</strong> $300 minimum</li>
          <li><strong>Declined Credit Card</strong> Charges + $5 penalty fee</li>
          <li><strong>Excess Time (Non Waive time)</strong> $1 for every 10 mins. ($5.99/hour)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="special-cleaning">Special Cleaning </h4>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Smoking</strong> $200</li>
          <li><strong>Pet not in carrier/odor</strong> $50</li>
          <li><strong>Damage to the interior</strong> Our costs to repair</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There’s a few unfortunate events that can happen where we have pass the costs on to you:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Public Garage Parking Fee</strong> Cost to remove vehicle from garage + $40 parking violation</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle Recovery (inside Santa Monica)</strong> Miscellaneous Recovery Costs</li>
          <li><strong>Parking Ticket</strong> Ticket Price + $20.00 Handling fee (unless user pays themselves)</li>
          <li><strong>Impounded Vehicle</strong> Cost of impound fee + $100 recovery</li>
          </ul>
          <aside>
          The <em>best</em> way to avoid fees is to make sure the vehicle doesn’t ever get too low. Remember, there’s plenty of free places to charge a WaiveCar.
          </aside>
          <p>If the car is physically damaged during the rental due to things such as an accident, we will hold $1,000 deposit and will return it to you if the insurance determines you are not at fault.</p>
