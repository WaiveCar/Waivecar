Experienced Startup Developer to join Small Team

We're a funded cash-flow positive startup in Santa Monica paying market rates
with benefits looking for a full-time developer.

Send us one or more of the following that you believe reliably represent you:

 * resume 
 * github account
 * hacker news/reddit account name
 * portfolio or personal website
 
Please feel free to apply if you have a lot of experience in programming and startups regardless of
whether you've done the particular technologies we work with: javascript
(react, angular, es6 harmony etc) and mobile (android, swift, etc).

You should be able to be able to get to Santa Monica in a reasonable amount of time - 
although we are comfortable with offsite work.

The most important thing for us is your process, character, and intuition with
regard to software development.

If you could include a cover letter talking about how you'd address this, that'd be great:

  Let's say a non-technical person reports a problem and proposes a solution,
  what do you see as your job and list of priorities?
