## What is WaiveCar?
WaiveCar is the first ever FREE & 100% emission free car sharing program. We are ad-supported so the funds we receive from advertisers to display their ads on our roof-mounted screens and body wraps allow users to drive our cars FREE for 2 hours then $5.99/hr...MIC DROP.

## Signing up
### What do I need to sign up?
All you need to sign up with WaiveCar is a mobile phone, access to the internet, credit card, a valid driver's license, and a good driving record. If you have a smartphone, simply download the app from your app store!

#### What's a good driving record?
To us, a good driving record means one without any:
 * DUIs
 * Moving violations
 * Driving with a suspended license
 * Any similar negligent or reckless acts
 * Accidents

### Does it cost any money to sign up?
Nope! We promise there REALLY are no catches. We're that magical.

### Why do I need a credit card to sign up if it's free?
We charge a temporary $20 hold on your card when you book a car that is immediately refunded just to make sure there are funds in case you go over the 2 free hours!

### How old do I need to be to drive WaiveCar?
You need to be 18+ to use WaiveCar CSULA and 21+ to user WaiveCar Electric (on LA's West side).

### Can I use my iPad/tablet to use WaiveCar?
No. Unfortunately we require a mobile phone so that a phone number can be attached to the account as well as GPS services.

### Is insurance included?
Yep! Insurance with a $1,000 deductible is included in the signup! The information is in the glove box!

### Can I use an out of state drivers license to drive with WaiveCar?
Yep! However, if you have a Pennsylvania, Utah or Washington license, please email us at support@waive.car as those states require a separate background check form to be filled out.

### Can I use an out of country drivers license?
Yep! However you will need to contact your country's DMV equivalent to obtain a driving record to email to us at support@waive.car (It must be translated into English)

### Can I use a temporary drivers license?
Unfortunately you will need a permanent license to drive with WaiveCar.

### How long does the signup take?
It's very quick! Should only take about 15 minutes for the signup and the background check to complete. If the background check seems to be taking longer, please contact us.

## Booking Cars
### What are WaiveCar's hours?
Our cars are available from 5am - 1am and the customer service line is open from 8am-10pm. If you need assistance at other hours, simply send us an email at support@waive.car and we will reach you at our earliest convenience. 

### How do I book a WaiveCar?
Log onto the app and find the closest available WaiveCar to you. Hit "Book it"! You then have 15 minutes to get to the car before the reservation times out.

### Where can I get a WaiveCar?
We have WaiveCars parked in designated spots throughout campus. 

### How long do I have to get to a WaiveCar?
You have 15 minutes to get to a WaiveCar before the reservation times out. You may purchase an additional 10 minutes for a $1 fee. 

If you are 55 or over, you automatically get WaiveAid. WaiveAid allows you 25 minutes to get to your WaiveCar, for free, every time. You can still purchase an additional 10 minutes more for $1, totaling 35 minutes. If you are under 55 and need assistance, such as having a child in stroller or a handicap placard, please contact us

Once you get there, please make sure you drive the WaiveCar! We may have to forfeit your booking if the WaiveCar isn't being used. But don't worry, we send out a message beforehand and you'll have plenty of time to contact us if we've made a mistake.

### Can I reserve a car in advance?
Unlike a rental company, you CANNOT reserve a car in advance. WaiveCar believes in the convenience of giving you a free car NOW! Get it while it's hot!

### Can I book multiple cars a day?
Yep! And even better, you will get the free 2 hours for EVERY ride!

However, there is a 30 minute wait to re-book the car you just finished renting. We do allow you to skip the wait period for a $5 charge.

### Does the free 2 hours start when I reserve a car or when I start the ride?
When you start the ride! Enjoy your leisurely walk!

### Is the free 2 hours only when I'm driving the car?
Nope! The free 2 hours counts for having the car while it's driving or parked. 

### What happens if I don't make it to the car in 15 minutes?
Then your reservation will expire! So hurry up and try to rebook the same car or another WaiveCar before it's gone! We're a hot commodity!

### What's with that $20 charge when I book a WaiveCar?
No worries! It's just a $20 hold on your card we will refund right back to you when your ride is complete!

## Driving Cars
### How far can I drive with a WaiveCar?
You can drive up to 25 miles outside of campus, which includes most of LA. You will get a text message alert when you have passed the boundaries! Along with being free the first 2 hours, a single WaiveCar can be rented for up to 12 hours at a time.

### Where are the keys?
#### In our Hyundai Tucsons 
You don't need keys to start the car, however if you need to lock the car DURING your rental, the keys are on a sensor in the glovebox! Just make sure you replace them when you're done.

### I've never driven a Fuel Cell (Hydrogen) car,  How many miles per tank do I get?
Our Hyundai Tucsons have 250-300 miles per fill-up, depending on driving style.

### What should I do if I'm running low on fuel?
Head back to campus. You can fuel the vehicle outside of campus but a full hydrogen tank can run you up to $80!

### Do you guys cover the the refueling? Yes, but only when using the campus refueling station!
### Can someone else drive using my account?
This one's a big N.O. The ONLY person allowed to drive a WaiveCar is the person on the account who has booked the car. Big consequences if we find out otherwise!

### What happens if there's a parking ticket?
If you get a ticket, you have 7 days to pay it. If you don't pay it within that time, we will charge your account for the amount due. If you see a ticket from a previous user, simply put it in the glove box.

## Ending Your Ride
### Where can I park when I'm done?
All rentals must be returned to the lot in which you rented it.

### How do I end my ride?
First make sure that you are parked in an accurate spot (see above). Turn off the car, put the key back on the sensor in the glovebox, grab your belongings, and exit the car. Select "End Ride" from the app and input the appropriate information. If you haven't received a confirmation text please call us at 855-WAIVE55!

### Do I need to clean the car when I'm done?
Yes! No need for an extensive cleaning, but make sure all your belongings are out of the car and clean up any trash you may leave. If you leave a mess, there could be a cleaning fee!
