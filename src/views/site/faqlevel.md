## What is WaiveCar?
WaiveCar is the first ever FREE & 100% electric car sharing program. We are ad-supported so the funds we receive from advertisers to display their ads on our roof-mounted screens and body wraps allow users to drive our cars FREE for 2 hours then $5.99/hr. 

Currently in New York, we are an amenity exclusively available for residents of level.

## Signing up
### What do I need to sign up?
All you need to sign up with WaiveCar is to be a resident of level, a smart phone, credit/debit card, a valid driver's license, and a good driving record. Simply download the app from your app store!

### Does it cost any money to sign up?

### Why do I need a credit/debit card to sign up if it's free?
We charge a temporary $1 hold on your card when you book a car that will be refunded as soon as your ride is over just to make sure there are funds in case you go over the 2 free hours!

### How old do I need to be to drive WaiveCar?
You need to be 21 to drive with WaiveCar.

Then your reservation will expire! So hurry up and try to rebook the same car or another WaiveCar before it's gone! We're a hot commodity!

No worries! It's just a $1 hold on your card we will refund right back to you when your ride is complete!

## Driving Cars
### How far can I drive with a WaiveCar?
The Chevy Sparks have between a 50 and 70 mile range depending on your driving style. You are at liberty to charge the car if you'd like for longer journeys. Along with being free the first 2 hours, a single WaiveCar can be rented for up to 12 hours at a time.

### Where are the keys?
You don't need keys to start the car, however if you need to lock the car DURING your rental, the keys are on a sensor in the glovebox! Just make sure you replace them when you're done.

### What should I do if I'm running low on charge?
Check the app for the closest fast charger, or download the app "Plugshare". Give us a call at 855-WAIVE55 if there is any confusion and we can direct you to one!

### Do you guys cover the charging station costs?
Nope! Just like other services, we don't compensate to refuel/recharge, however just bring it back to the HQ where they will charge for FREE and see if you can switch out for a higher charged car!

### How much does it usually cost to charge an electric car?
Fast chargers typically cost around $10 and take about 15 minutes. Level 2 chargers take about 6 hours to fully charge but can be free depending on the station. Call us if there's ANY confusion!

### Can someone else drive using my account?
This one's a big N.O. The ONLY person allowed to drive a WaiveCar is the person on the account who has booked the car. Big consequences if we find out otherwise!

### What happens if there's a parking ticket?
If you get a ticket, you have 10 days to pay it. If you don't pay it within that time, we will charge your account for the amount due. If you see a ticket from a previous user, simply put it in the glove box.

## Ending Your Ride

### Where can I park when I'm done?
All WaiveCars must be returned to the 24 hour parking lot at 34 N 7th Street. You won't need to pay anything at the lot, so don't worry - the attendants will help you.

### How do I end my ride?
First make sure that you have returned the vehicle to the parking lot. Turn off the car, put the key back on the sensor in the glovebox, grab your belongings, and exit the car. Select "End Ride" from the app and input the appropriate information. If you haven't received a confirmation text please call us at 855-WAIVE55!

### Do I need to clean the car when I'm done?
Yes! No need for an extensive cleaning, but make sure all your belongings are out of the car and clean up any trash you may leave. If you leave a mess, there could be a cleaning fee!

Nope! Follow the rules above. If the car is under 25 miles charged, simply return it at the HQ!
