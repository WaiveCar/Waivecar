## What is WaiveCar?
WaiveCar is the first ever FREE & 100% electric car sharing program. We are ad-supported so the funds we receive from advertisers to display their ads on our roof-mounted screens and body wraps allow users to drive our cars FREE for 2 hours then $5.99/hr...MIC DROP.

## Signing up
### What do I need to sign up?
All you need to sign up with WaiveCar is a smart phone, credit/debit card, a valid driver's license, and a good driving record. Simply download the app from your app store!

 * Any similar negligent or reckless acts

### Does it cost any money to sign up?
Nope! We promise there REALLY are no catches. We're that magical.

### Why do I need a credit/debit card to sign up if it's free?
We charge a temporary $1 hold on your card when you book a car that will be refunded as soon as your ride is over just to make sure there are funds in case you go over the 2 free hours!

### How old do I need to be to drive WaiveCar?
You need to be 21 to drive with WaiveCar.

### Can I use my iPad/tablet to use WaiveCar?

Yep! Insurance with a $1,000 deductible is included in the signup! The information is in the glove box!

### Can I use an out of state drivers license to drive with WaiveCar?
Yep! However, if you have a Pennsylvania license, please email us at support@waive.car as Pennsylvania requires a separate background check form to be filled out.

### Can I use an out of country drivers license?
Yep! However you will need to contact your DMV and obtain a driving record to email to us at support@waive.car

### Can I use a temporary drivers license?

Nope! The free 2 hours counts for having the car while it's driving or parked. 

### What happens if I don't make it to the car in 15 minutes?
Then your reservation will expire! So hurry up and try to rebook the same car or another WaiveCar before it's gone! We're a hot commodity!

No worries! It's just a $1 hold on your card we will refund right back to you when your ride is complete!

### How many WaiveCars are there?
We currently have 37 in Santa Monica and we are expanding very soon.

## Driving Cars
### How far can I drive with a WaiveCar?
You can drive up to 20 miles outside our HQ in Santa Monica, which includes most of LA. You will get a text message alert when you have passed the boundaries! Along with being free the first 2 hours, a single WaiveCar can be rented for up to 12 hours at a time.

### Where are the keys?
You don't need keys to start the car, however if you need to lock the car DURING your rental, the keys are on a sensor in the glovebox! Just make sure you replace them when you're done.

### I've never driven an electric car. How many miles per charge do I get?
Our Chevy Spark EVs have 50-70 miles per charge, depending on driving style. Our Hyundai Ioniqs have between 110-130 depending on driving style.

### What should I do if I'm running low on charge?
Check the app for the closest fast charger, or download the app "Plugshare". Give us a call at 855-WAIVE55 if there is any confusion and we can direct you to one!

### Do you guys cover the charging station costs?
Nope! Just like other services, we don't compensate to refuel/recharge, however just bring it back to the HQ where they will charge for FREE and see if you can switch out for a higher charged car!

### How much does it usually cost to charge an electric car?
Fast chargers typically cost around $10 and take about 15 minutes. Level 2 chargers take about 6 hours to fully charge but can be free depending on the station. Call us if there's ANY confusion!

### Is it true I can drive in the carpool lane on the highway?
Yep! More magic.

### Can someone else drive using my account?
This one's a big N.O. The ONLY person allowed to drive a WaiveCar is the person on the account who has booked the car. Big consequences if we find out otherwise!

### What happens if there's a parking ticket?
If you get a ticket, you have 10 days to pay it. If you don't pay it within that time, we will charge your account for the amount due. If you see a ticket from a previous user, simply put it in the glove box.
