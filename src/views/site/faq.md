## What is WaiveCar?
WaiveCar is the first ever FREE & 100% electric car sharing program. We are ad-supported so the funds we receive from advertisers to display their ads on our roof-mounted screens and body wraps allow users to drive our cars FREE for 2 hours then $5.99/hr...MIC DROP.

## Signing up
### What do I need to sign up?
All you need to sign up with Waive is a smart phone, credit card, a valid driver's license, and a good driving record. Simply download the app from your app store!

<small>Otherwise, if you have reliable access to a computer with the internet and a traditional cellphone, using our service is a bit more work still entirely possible (many of our frequest users do this). Register through [our website](https://waive.car), then [use WaiveBasic to find cars](https://medium.com/@Waive/introducing-waivebasic-the-simple-way-to-waive-41ea9df926b9) and control the [car over text during the booking](https://medium.com/@Waive/how-to-control-a-waivecar-over-text-7a1cc6176b45).</small>

#### What's a good driving record?

To us, a good driving record means one without any:

* DUIs
* Moving violations
* Driving with a suspended license
* Any similar negligent or reckless acts
* Accidents

### Does it cost any money to sign up?
Nope! We promise there REALLY are no catches. We're that magical.

### Why do I need a credit card to sign up if it's free?
We charge a temporary $20 hold on your card when you book a car that is immediately refunded just to make sure there are funds in case you go over the 2 free hours!

### How old do I need to be to drive WaiveCar?
You need to be 21 to drive with WaiveCar.

### Can I use my iPad/tablet to use WaiveCar?
No. Unfortunately we require a cell phone so that a phone number can be attached to the account as well as GPS services.

### Is insurance included?
Yep! Insurance with a $1,000 deductible is included in the signup! The information is in the app!

### Can I use an out of state drivers license to drive with WaiveCar?

Yep! However, if you have a Pennsylvania, Utah or Washington license, please email us at support@waive.car as those states require a separate background check form to be filled out.

### Can I use an out of country drivers license?

Yep! However you will need to contact your country's DMV equivalent to obtain a driving record to email to us at support@waive.car (It must be translated into English)

### Can I use a temporary drivers license?
Unfortunately you will need a permanent license to drive with WaiveCar.

### How long does the signup take?

It's very quick! Should only take about 15 minutes for the signup and the background check to complete. If the background check seems to be taking longer, please contact us.

## Booking Cars

### What are WaiveCar's hours?

Our cars are available 24 hours and the customer service line is open from 9am-10pm. If you need assistance at other hours, simply send us an email at support@waive.car and we will reach you at our earliest convenience. 

### How do I book a WaiveCar?
Log onto the app and find the closest available WaiveCar to you. You then have 15 minutes to get to the car before the reservation times out.

### Where can I get a WaiveCar?

Right now our cars are dispersed between Marina Del Rey and Hollywood, check our map in our app for more details. 

### How long do I have to get to a WaiveCar?

You have 15 minutes to get to a WaiveCar before the reservation times out. You may purchase an additional 10 minutes for a $1 fee and $.30/min thereafter until you get to the vehicle.
If you are 55 or over, you automatically get WaiveAid. WaiveAid allows you 25 minutes to get to your WaiveCar, for free, every time. You can still purchase an additional 10 minutes more for $1, totaling 35 minutes. If you are under 55 and need assistance, such as having a child in stroller or a handicap placard, please contact us

Once you get there, please make sure you drive the WaiveCar! We may have to forfeit your booking if the WaiveCar isn't being used. But don't worry, we send out a message beforehand and you'll have plenty of time to contact us if we've made a mistake.

### Can I reserve a car in advance?
Yes! We have a program where you can hold a car overnight for a special flat rate until 10AM of $14.99. Book a high charged car after 10PM and you will be offered a program we call WaiveRush. Hourly charges won't begin until 10AM.

### Can I book multiple cars a day?
Yep! And even better, you will get the free 2 hours for EVERY ride!

However, there is a 25 minute wait to re-book the car you just finished renting. We do allow you to skip the wait period for a fee.

### Does the free 2 hours start when I reserve a car or when I start the ride?
When you start the ride! Enjoy your leisurely walk!

### Is the free 2 hours only when I'm driving the car?
Nope! The free 2 hours counts for having the car while it's driving or parked. 

### What happens if I don't make it to the car in 15 minutes?
Then your reservation will expire! So make sure you book when you can get to the car within the free reservation time (15 minutes) and it'll be free. You can rebook a missed reservation for a fee.

### What's with that $20 charge when I book a WaiveCar?
No worries! It's just a $20 hold on your card we will refund right back to you when your ride is complete!

## Driving Cars
### How far can I drive with a WaiveCar?

You can drive up to 30 miles outside of any of our parking borders, which includes most of LA. You will get a text message alert when you have passed the boundaries! Along with being free the first 2 hours, a single WaiveCar can be rented for up to 12 hours at a time.

### Where are the keys?
There are no keys, simply use the app to lock, unlock and end all rides. 

### I've never driven an electric car. How many miles per charge do I get?
Our Hyundai Ioniqs have between 110-140 depending on driving style.

### What should I do if I'm running low on charge?
Check the app for the closest fast charger, or download the app "PlugShare". Give us a call at 855-WAIVE55 if there is any confusion and we can direct you to one!

### Do you guys cover the charging station costs?
If you use a charger listed in the app with our partners, EVgo, charging is free and can be done in under 30 minutes. You will also [receive credit](https://medium.com/@Waive/free-fast-charging-this-changes-everything-again-b7480f8d0dd4) if you end the ride at a higher charge than when you began it at.

### Is it true I can drive in the carpool lane on the highway?
As of January 1, 2019, CA law has changed and some of our cars no longer have special car pool lane privileges because they need to be re-registered and re-tagged. We are working on making sure all of our vehicles have the proper decals and will notify you when they do.  Until then, cars with a red decal on the back have special car pool privileges.

### Can someone else drive using my account?
This one's a big N.O. The ONLY person allowed to drive a WaiveCar is the person on the account who has booked the car. Big consequences if we find out otherwise!

### What happens if there's a parking ticket?

If you get a ticket, you have 7 days to pay it. If you don't pay it within that time, we will charge your account for the amount due. If you see a ticket from a previous user, simply put it in the glove box. You can also, if you'd like, take a photo of it during the end or beginning of your ride in the "issues" section so we can address it ASAP.

## Ending Your Ride

### Where can I park when I'm done?

If the battery is over 25 miles charged, you can park at any 3 hour public parking spot in Santa Monica excluding metered parking. Outside of Santa Monica 12 hours of free parking is needed. Please note, if the battery is under 25 miles charged you MUST return it at the headquarters at 2102 Pico Blvd in Santa Monica (Not 2102 Pico near S Alverado St).

However, after 10pm, parking must be valid until 10:00 AM that morning.

### Where can I **NOT** park?
Private parking spaces, parking garages, permit-only spots, any business parking lot, or ANYWHERE not in our operating area! Make sure to check street signs so that there are no parking restrictions on the spot for 3 hours(in SM) and 12 hours (Outside of SM).

We have a program where you can declare a parking space you own to be valid for any waivecar to park at. [Check out our medium post for more info](https://medium.com/@Waive/want-waivecars-to-magically-appear-delivered-free-to-your-driveway-fa05bb3a345b).

### Do I need to clean the car when I'm done?
Yes! No need for an extensive cleaning, but make sure all your belongings are out of the car and clean up any trash you may leave. If you leave a mess, there could be a cleaning fee!
